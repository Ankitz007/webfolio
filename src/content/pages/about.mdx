I never thought my dream was to be a Software Engineer. During my
school days, I tried sports, science, (chess) and what not â€” but I
kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn
something different. Then I joined college.

And that's when it happened: the spark I was missing ignited the
instant I clicked play on my first <code>Python tutorial</code> video (<code>The New Boston</code>, if I remember correctly). Since then, I can't get enough. Software
development calls to all my passions; it combines creativity and
problem solving, and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a
separate Git branch, of course).

I like to <code>automate things</code> and find solutions for <code>real life problems using code</code>. I'm highly fascinated by FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and
want to contribute to the Open Source community. When it comes to web
development, I love applying responsive design principles and watching
pages shrink into mobile screens and still look great. I am fascinated
by the way back-end interacts with front-end and delivers smooth, fast
interactions to clients.

    This is how my den looks like. Well, not exactly, but you get the
    idea, right?

<Callout variant="fact" title="Actually, the truth ðŸ˜‚">
  <p>I can usually be found doing two things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Binge watching TV-shows/movies</li>
    <li>Exploring Software and Systems</li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other tools, techniques,
or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. Iâ€™m also
eager to meet other software developers in the area, so feel free to
connect!
