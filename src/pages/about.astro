          I never thought my dream was to be a Software Engineer. During my
          school days, I tried sports, science, (chess) and what not â€” but I
          kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn
          something different. Then I joined college.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that's when it happened: the spark I was missing ignited the
          instant I clicked play on my first <code>Python tutorial</code> video (<code
            >The New Boston</code
          >, if I remember correctly). Since then, I can't get enough. Software
          development calls to all my passions; it combines creativity and
          problem solving, and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a
          separate Git branch, of course).
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to <code>automate things</code> and find solutions for <code
            >real life problems using code</code
          >. I'm highly fascinated by FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and
          want to contribute to the Open Source community. When it comes to web
          development, I love applying responsive design principles and watching
          pages shrink into mobile screens and still look great. I am fascinated
          by the way back-end interacts with front-end and delivers smooth, fast
          interactions to clients.

          <p>I can usually be found doing two things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Binge watching TV-shows/movies</li>
            <li>Exploring Software and Systems</li>
          </ul>
        </Callout>

        <p>
          I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other tools, techniques,
          or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. Iâ€™m also
          eager to meet other software developers in the area, so feel free to
          connect!
